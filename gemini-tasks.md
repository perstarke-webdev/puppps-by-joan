Shepherds Pie
Perfect for St. Patrick’s Day or just a special treat!

1 lb. ground beef
1 cup peas and chopped carrots
1 russet potato
2 Tblsp. [lain unsweetened yogurt OR cream cheese
¼ tsp. Oregano

Brown the ground beef in a skillet, add the oregano. Peel and chop the potato, boil until done, then mix with either yogurt or cream cheese to make mashed potatoes Separately, boil the peas and carrots until soft.  In a baking dish, add the ground beef, then layer the cooked peas and carrots, finishing with the mashed potatoes on top.  Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes.


Basic Homemade Dinner

5 lbs.ground beef, turkey, or chicken
1 cup quinoa
1 cup vegetables: broccoli, asparagus, green beans, brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes
⅛ of an apple, peeled and cored
A few blueberries or cranberries

Heat over to 400.  Place protein in a roasting pan.  While it is baking, add two cups water to quinoa and prepare in a pan.  I mix the vegetables, berries and apple in with the quinoa and cook together, or you can do so separately.  Check the oven after ten minutes, flip the meat over so browns on other side, and continue to cook until it is no longer pink.  Then combine the meat, quinoa and vegetables.

For an occasional treat, you can serve as above.  If you are preparing this as your dog’s primary food, then you’ll want to consider adding   vitamins, minerals, omega’s and a probiotic.  Dr. Dobias.com is where I purchase these items and more for my dogs.  I am not a pet nutritionist, however I have consulted with a few and recommend you also do your own research if you are planning to cook for your pups on a regular basis.

Do you agree?
Let's create this. For the imagess in the PDF; use placeholder (use images we alreayd have in this repo), i will replace them later.

Take the content from the pdf + the text above, update phrasing if needed, and create a new page for this, or what would you suggest?
Write to gemin plan your plan before acting, so i can confirm. Give me your insights on how to best implement this. New page, or subsection?

Doris Day owned this lovely boutique inn, and her legacy lives on, a treasured place where pets are welcomed and pampered in old Hollywood luxury. It is my favorite place for a pet friendly stay!
