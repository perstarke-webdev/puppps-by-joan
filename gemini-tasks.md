I got this text as well from Joan:

Did you know that some other countries manage pet animal welfare by strictly regulating how many persons are licensed to breed and the numbers of litters and total pet population?  For example, Germany has around ten million pets compared to the U.S. with nearly ninety million dogs, and eighty eight million cats?  That’s just the known pets and the actual number is likely much higher.   Is it any wonder why there’s more coming into shelters and being euthanized because our society simply cannot support that many?

While there are many related factors and currently (late 2025) many surrenders are due to owners losing their housing, general costs to keep pets, and medical care costs.  All shelters are overwhelmed.  It is sad and unfair to the animals.  Volunteers and workers at shelters are frantically doing their very best to house and care for as many as possible in hopes of finding them homes.  The overwhelming volume of homeless pets is at an all time high and to me is like a NEON SIGN:  WE NEED IMMEDIATE NEW ANIMAL WELFARE LAWS STRICTLY ENFORCED UNTIL NUMBERS ARE GREATLY REDUCED.  A NEW LOWER VOLUME THRESHOLD MUST BE OBTAINED AND THEN MAINTAINED.  Please take action, be a voice for animals and help bring much needed change!

Here’s an action plan; reach out to your community leaders and lawmakers, initiate and drive creation of laws (examples to propose below), gather petition signatures in your community in order to qualify to appear on next ballot, or, pursue leaders who have the willingness and ability to enact changes directly:

*	Enforced laws requiring ALL breeders to be licensed and registered in their state, the number of licenses given out based on adoption rate statistics minus fifty percent until all shelters at 20% capacity with zero euthanasia of healthy pets; credentials and requirements high, with inspections and on- going monitoring.  NO “backyard breeders”.  No pet owners “having just one litter”.  Heavy financial penalties that effectively change behavior.  Repeat offenders jail time. Until we get this under control, then review the number of breeder licenses.
*	Hotlines for members of the community to call and report roadside signs “puppies for sale”.  A social media campaign to educate everyone, before buying a puppy from a breeder, and demand to see their license and a website to verify it’s legitimate, and the financial penalties for failing to do so.  Unlicensed breeders should be fined $5000 per puppy they sell/sold or have in their possession,  for first offense and double plus a year of jail per puppy, if they are  repeat offenders.  People should be fined $5000 for purchasing from an unlicensed breeder.  (Based on estimated cost for proper care and housing resulting for a pet in the overpopulation, actual cost could vary but my point is, the penalty should be proportional and high enough to cause people to think about consequences)
*	All  pets spay/neuter for free, mandatory, and enforced but allowing owners to adopt/rescue unneutered and unspayed animals, and become responsible for having it done when pets are old enough to safely do so.

*	Community based action team that works in the community, going to homes, meeting with people having pet issues and trying to resolve them before surrendering and hotline and location for people to seek assistance.  Most surrenders are due to financial and behavioral issues.  By offering training and behavior modification support as well as financial support, fewer will be surrendered.  Also,  program to include volunteers go out after adoptions and ensure the pet and family are settling in successfully and providing support where needed to eliminate resurrenders.

*	Repurposing shelter space for telehealth, community clinic services and training

*	Oversight: staff and personnel from some of the rescue organizations, since there will be fewer needing rescue

*	Funding: calculate the amount needed and add .05 percent to county tax rate and/or a portion to Federal tax structure.  This is a societal issue, everyone should be part of the solution.  It’s no different than a teeny portion going to schools, even if we don’t have children. Another revenue source if needed would be an extra percentage tax on all pet goods and services (excluding veterinary care costs)

*	Even if the beginning plan isn’t perfect, SOMETHING is needed.  Drastic cuts to overbreeding to start with and then adjusted and managed as needed..

I am not sure where and how to integrate it. Please make suggestions, cleanly and easily, good for the page flow and purpose, in gemini review md.
