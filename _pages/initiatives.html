        <h2>Animal Health & Nutrition</h2>
        <p>
            Good health starts with good information. Many pet owners are left guessing when it comes to nutrition, chronic conditions, or conflicting advice from professionals.

            Through the PUPPPâ€™s Podcast and future learning resources, weâ€™re exploring both traditional and holistic perspectives â€” with the goal of empowering pet owners to make informed, compassionate choices.

        <h2>Ending Animal Lab Experiments</h2>
        <p>
            More than 40,000 dogs are used in experiments each year in the U.S. funded with tax payer dollars.  In addition, tens of thousands of puppies destined for labs are born at breeding facilities each year.  This number increases dramatically worldwide. (of course this doesnâ€™t account for kittens, monkeys and others and that number climbs even higher)
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of experiments, dogs are typically killed.  Many  are not given any pain medication to help relieve their suffering or distress during or after experiments.  This is NOT a small problem!  Experiments using dogs are happening in 46 U.S. states, D.C. and Puerto Rico.  The federal government plays a role by funding and requiring and carrying out these experiments.  In 2024 alone, the National Institutes of Health awarded over $ 50 million in tax dollars!
        </p>
        <p>
            The most effective approach to end these experiments on dogs (and other animals) is to cut off the funding and you can help by signing petitions regarding legislation, and letters to representatives.  By clicking the links  below you can easily take action that will contribute to ending animal suffering, and demand investment in research that doesnâ€™t cause animal suffering.  The other action you can take to support animals is to share links and information with others.  Only through awareness can we take positive action for the innocent animals.
